This is a percentage of full_charge. Default is 10% (500). siege_deplete integer\t100 Sets the amount of energy Siege mode uses every cycle. Default is 100. siege_creeper integer\t150 Sets the amount of energy gained when the Artron Creeper is sacrificed. The default is 150. Only relevant if the main config option siege.creeper is set to true. siege_ticks integer\t1500 Sets the amount of time in server ticks that the energy depletion / siege mode healing cycle takes. The default is 1500 (or every 1.25 minutes). standby integer\t5 Sets how much energy is used per cycle when the TARDIS is in standby power mode. standby_time integer\t6000 Sets how often energy is removed when the TARDIS is in standby mode. If standby_time is set to 0, then no energy is removed. jettison\tinteger\t75 Sets the percentage of energy the TARDIS gets back when a room is jettisoned. jettison_seed\tMaterial\tTNT Sets the block required to manually jettison a room. renderer\tinteger\t250 Sets the cost to use the Renderer room. zero\tinteger\t250 Sets the cost to transmat to the TARDIS Zero room. upgrades ancient\tinteger\t5000 ars\tinteger\t5000 bigger\tinteger\t7500 budget\tinteger\t5000 cave\tinteger\t5000 copper\tinteger\t20000 coral\tinteger\t8000 delta\tinteger\t7500 deluxe\tinteger\t10000 division\tinteger\t7500 eleventh\tinteger\t10000 ender\tinteger\t5000 factory\tinteger\t7500 fugitive\tinteger\t7500 hospital\tinteger\t5000 master\tinteger\t10000 mechanical\tinteger\t7500 original\tinteger\t5000 plank\tinteger\t5000 pyramid\tinteger\t5000 redstone\tinteger\t7500 rotor\tinteger\t5000 steampunk\tinteger\t5000 thirteenth\tinteger\t8000 tom\tinteger\t5000 twelfth\tinteger\t7500 war\tinteger\t5000 weathered\tinteger\t5000 custom\tinteger\t10000 legacy_deluxe\tinteger\t10000 legacy_redstone\tinteger\t8000 legacy_bigger\tinteger\t7500 legacy_eleventh\tinteger\t10000 Sets the energy cost to upgrade / crossgrade to a different console when using the Desktop Theme changer. archive tall\tinteger\t10000 small\tinteger\t5000 medium\tinteger\t7500 Sets the energy cost to use different archive console sizes when using the Desktop Theme changer. template medium\tinteger\t2500 small\tinteger\t1666 tall\tinteger\t3333 Sets the energy cost to use a console template when using the Desktop Theme changer. just_wall_floor\tinteger\t50 If a player is just changing the walls and floor, then just_wall_floor sets the percentage the cost is reduced. artron_furnace Sets the options for Artron Furnaces. See further explanation on the Artron Furnace page. cook_time\tfloat\t0.5 Sets the cook time for items smelted with Artron Storage Cells — 0.5 is half the normal time, 2.0 would be twice normal speed (longer), 1.0 = normal cook time (same as coal) burn_time\tfloat\t0.5 Sets the length of time an Artron Storage Cell will burn for — as above fractions (0.5) will give shorter life to the cells, &gt; 1 will extend the burn time, 1.0 = normal burn time (same as coal) burn_limit\tinteger\t100000 Sets the maximum amount of burn time a fully charged Artron Storage Cell can have. particles\tboolean\ttrue Sets whether the Artron Furnace block displays particles. sonic_generator standard\tinteger\t10 bio\tinteger\t10 diamond\tinteger\t10 emerald\tinteger\t10 redstone\tinteger\t10 painter\tinteger\t10 ignite\tinteger\t10 arrow\tinteger\t10 knockback\tinteger\t10 brush\tinteger\t10 Sets the energy costs for the sonic generator as a percentage of the full_charge option. shell\tinteger\t500 Sets the cost to use the Shell room constructor. custard_cream\tinteger\t25 Sets the cost to dispense a custard cream. backdoor\tinteger\t100 Sets the cost to use the TARDIS back door.

Weeping Angels can only be killed with the configured weapon - by default a DIAMOND_PICKAXE - hitting them with anything else has no effect. When they die they drop a random (1-3) amount of STONE. The angels move pretty fast, but you can freeze them in place by looking at them and quickly pressing the sneak key. Better arm yourself or flee quickly though, as they’ll be after you again in a snap - and if they touch you, you’ll be teleported away to a random location. If the TARDIS plugin is also installed, your TARDIS Key will be stolen.  Random teleport locations can be specified by world, or you can set specific locations to teleport players to. Random teleports are set in the angels.teleport_worlds section in monsters.yml. Add all the worlds you want to allow teleports to. A random location will be generated from loaded chunks in a randomly selected world.Specific teleport locations require angels.teleport_to_location to be set to true.
