# Artron Capacitor

Artron Capacitors are used to increase the amount of energy a TARDIS can store. Capacitors are stored in the [Artron Capacitor Storage](artron-capacitor-storage) block found in the [Eye of Harmony](/rooms/eye) room. Every TARDIS comes with one Artron Capacitor installed when first grown.

For each capacitor stored, the energy capacity is increased by 100%, up to 500% of the `full_charge` amount specified in _artron.yml_. With the default setting of `5000` this allows you to overcharge the TARDIS up to `25,000`. By comparison the highest desktop theme upgrade cost is by default `20,000`.

Capacitors can be damaged by TARDIS malfunction events. For each damaged capacitor the TARDIS energy capacity is reduced by half the `full_charge` amount.

Damaged capactiors can be repaired in a [smithing table](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Smithing_Table) with redstone and copper ingots.

## Storage

Artron Capacitors should be stored in the [Eye of Harmony](/rooms/eye) room. Next to the door at the end of the walkway is the [Artron Capacitor Storage](/recipes/items/artron-capacitor-storage) block.

To increase the Artron Energy storage capacity, place up to 5 Artron Capacitors in the middle slots.
