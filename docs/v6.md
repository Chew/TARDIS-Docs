# Changes in TARDIS version 6

Version 6 of the TARDIS plugin contains some major rewrites of the plugin's code to update it to reflect the way Minecraft has changed custom item models.

You may find that you need to rebuild your TARDIS exterior, and update custom TARDIS items, lights and blocks.

## Items

For the most part, using the item will update the model.

Other items can be updated by running the `/tardis item hand` command while holding the item in your main hand, or running `/tardis item inventory` to update all items in your current inventory.

## Lights

To update the lights in your TARDIS, run the `/tardis update lights` command. This should affect lights in the ARS grid as well, but may take some time.

## Blocks

To update the custom blocks in your TARDIS, run the `/tardis update blocks` command. This should will attempt to update blocks in the ARS grid as well, but may take some time.
