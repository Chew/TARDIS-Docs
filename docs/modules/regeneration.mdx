# Regeneration

![Regeneration](/images/skins/regeneration.png)

## Enabling the module

To use the Regeneration module, it must be enabled in the TARDIS config.

- Type `/tardisconfig regeneration [true|false]` to enable or disable the feature.
- A server restart is required when changing the config value.

The Regeneration models and textures are part of the [TARDIS-Resource-Pack](/resource-packs).

## Permissions

Players require the `tardis.refgeneration` permission in order to be able to regenerate.

## Triggering a regeneration

Regenerations occur when a player dies. Instead of dying the player will assume a regeneration pose with particle effects.
- While the player is regenerating, they cannot be hurt.
- Their skin changes to the Doctor associated with the number of 
regenerations the player has used - _i.e. if this is the player's first regeneration their skill will change to the first 
Doctor's skin_.
- The skin will remain in effect for 90 seconds.
- If configured the player regains full health and food.
- The player may also receive positive (regeneration, slow falling) and negative (mining fatigue, slowness, weakness) potion effects.
- By default, a player has a maximum of 15 regenerations.

## Elixir of Life

The Elixir of Life can be used to trigger a regeneration at any time. To do this, drink the elixir.

## Getting more regenerations

If you have used up all your regenerations, you can craft and place the [Untempered Schism](/recipes/custom-blocks/untempered-schism). Walking into the Untempered Schism triggers your proto-Time Lord DNA to reset and allow another series of regenerations.

You can only reset regenerations if you have used up all of your existing ones.

The crafting recipe for the Untempered Schism is expensive, especially on _hard_ crafting difficulty.
