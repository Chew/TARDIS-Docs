# Regeneration

![Regeneration](/images/skins/regeneration.png)

## Enabling the module

To use the Regeneration module, it must be enabled in the TARDIS config.

- Type `/tardisconfig regeneration [true|false]` to enable or disable the feature.
- A server restart is required when changing the config value.

The Regeneration models and textures are part of the [TARDIS-Resource-Pack](/resource-packs).

## Permissions

Players require the `tardis.refgeneration` permission in order to be able to regenerate.

## Triggering a regeneration

Regenerations occur when a player dies. Instead of dying the player will assume a regeneration pose with particle effects.
- While the player is regenerating, they cannot be hurt.
- Their skin changes to the Doctor associated with the number of 
regenerations the player has used - _i.e. if this is the player's first regeneration their skill will change to the first 
Doctor's skin_.
- The skin will remain in effect for 90 seconds.
- If configured the player regains full health and food.
- The player may also receive positive (regeneration, slow falling) and negative (mining fatigue, slowness, weakness) potion effects.
- By default, a player has a maximum of 15 regenerations.

## Elixir of Life

The Elixir of Life can be used to trigger a regeneration at any time. To do this, drink the elixir.

## Getting more regenerations

Don't know what this will be yet...
