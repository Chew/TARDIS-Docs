# Weeping Angels

TARDISWeepingAngels is a TARDIS plugin module that transforms Minecraft mobs into terrifying
Whovian [monsters](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4tDN85fyxYXTtVPrCql8jB/monsters).

:::note

For TARDIS version 4.13.0 and below you can download the separate TARDISWeepingAngels plugin JAR from here: [TARDISWeepingAngels](http://tardisjenkins.duckdns.org:8080/job/TARDISWeepingAngels/)

The instructions below are for the TARDIS module, but are pretty much the same, with some extra configuration options
(database / plugin respect), and separate commands instead of sub-commands.

:::

## Enabling the module

To use the Weeping Angels module, it must be enabled in the TARDIS config.

- Type `/tardisconfig weeping_angels [true|false]` to enable or disable the feature.
- A server restart is required when changing the config value.

The TARDISWeepingAngel models and textures are part of the [TARDIS-Resource-Pack](/resource-packs).

## Requirements

**Version 4.x.x of this plugin/module requires Paper server or a compatible fork.**

Version 5 and higher will run on Spigot and Paper servers :)

For the full experience (textures and sounds), youâ€™ll need
the [TARDIS-Resource-Pack](/resource-packs)

## Monsters

* See the [list of monsters](./monsters.md)

## Features

For each monster:

- Configurable spawn rate
- Configurable drop on death
- Only spawn them in the worlds you want

## Monsters configuration

For configuration options, see the [Monsters configuration](./config.md) page.
