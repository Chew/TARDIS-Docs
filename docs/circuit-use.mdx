# Circuit use and repair

If configured (`difficulty.circuits: true` and `circuits.damage: true`), circuits can become damaged after use. When the tardis
malfunctions
there is a 50% chance that a circuit will become damaged even more than usual.

## Use

Circuit use will decrease in the following circumstances:

| Circuit                 | Used when                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ars                         | clicking the ‘Reconfigure’ button in the ARS GUI                                        |
| chameleon             | clicking the ‘Apply preset now’ button in the Chameleon Circuit GUI |
| input                     | setting a destination with the Destination Terminal                                 |
| invisibility        | selecting the Invisibility preset in the Chameleon Circuit GUI            |
| materialisation | the TARDIS re-materialises after travelling                                                 |
| memory                    | processing a disk in the Advanced Console                                                     |
| randomiser            | getting a random destination in the Advanced Console                                |
| scanner                 | pressing the Scanner button                                                                                 |
| telepathic            | searching for a cave, structure or biome travel location                        |
| temporal                | setting the time in the Temporal Locator GUI                                                |

## Repair

Circuits can be repaired by combining them with redstone in an anvil.

You need to click the output slot to make the repair. One redstone gives one level of use.

## Configuration options

The defaults are shown below:

```yaml title="/plugins/TARDIS/config.yml"
circuits:
    damage: false
    uses:
        ars: 20
        chameleon: 25
        input: 50
        invisibility: 5
        materialisation: 50
        memory: 20
        randomiser: 50
        scanner: 20
        telepathic: 20
        temporal: 20
```

<ConfigTable data={`
circuits:
    damage: false # Sets whether circuits get damaged after each use. Setting this to false (the default) means circuits have unlimited uses.
    uses:
        \<circuit\>: 20 # Sets the maximum number of uses a circuit has before it is vapourised. Setting this to \`0\` gives unlimited uses for that circuit.
`} />
