# Save Sign

If you have saved a travel location using the `/tardis save [save_name]` or `/tardis setdest [save_name]` commands, or the server admin has set up some
TARDIS Areas, you can time travel to them in the TARDIS by using the Save Sign GUI.

The Save Sign is accessible via the TARDIS Control Menu GUI, or you can place a sign and use
the `/tardis update save-sign` command.

In the Control Menu there are two “saves” buttons, if you are in someone else's TARDIS:
- The top button loads saves for the TARDIS you are in.
- The other button will load the saves from your own TARDIS.

Click a _Saves_ button (or if using a separate Save Sign, right-click it) to open the TARDIS Dimension Map inventory based GUI.

By default the first item in the GUI is the TARDIS’s “home” location.

After that is a list of dimensions / worlds that you have saves in. Click a world block to open the saves GUI for any locations that you have saved in that world.
Hovering over the blocks will show you the save name, world name and coordinates.

To travel to a saved location, simply click a block.

### Rearranging saves

In later versions of the plugin, saves can be rearranged into your preferred order. To do this, click the bottom left
block called “Rearrange saves” then move the saves into their desired positions. You cannot rearrange the “home”
location block.

Close the Save Sign GUI to keep the arrangement.

### Switching to TARDIS Areas

The bottom middle block in the Save Sign GUI lets you switch to the TARDIS Areas screen. Any areas set up by the server
administrator (and that you have permission for) will be shown here. To go to the location, click the block just like
you would for a save.
