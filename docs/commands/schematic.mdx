# TARDIS Schematic command

As of version 3.0-beta-1, TARDIS now uses its own JSON schematic format. To create a TARDIS schematic (.tschm) file, you
use the `/tardisschematic` command.

## /tardisschematic

<CommandTable data={
    `tardisschematic:
    aliases: [ tschematic, ts ]
    description: Save, load or paste a TARDIS schematic.
    permission: tardis.admin
    usage: /<command> [subcommand] [options...]
    `
}
args={
    `
    save:
      description: Save a TARDIS schematic. In order to use the \`save\` argument, you must first define the schematic region start and end points with the TARDIS schematic wand (\`/tardisgive [player] schematic_wand 1\`).
      usage: /<command> save [name]
    load:
      description: >
        Load a TARDIS schematic. To use the \`load\` argument, you must specify the folder and file \`[name]\` of the schematic you want to use. You don’t need to add the file extension. There are four \`[folder]\` locations;
        
        * \`user\` - this is the loaction for user made schematics found at _plugins/TARDIS/user\_schematcis_.
        
        * \`console\` - this contains all the plugin’s interior schematics.
        
        * \`room\` - this contains all the plugin’s room schematics.
        
        * \`structure\` - this contains all the plugin’s structure schematics used in TARDIS worlds.
      usage: /<command> load [console|room|structure|user] [name]
    paste:
      description: Paste a loaded TARDIS schematic. Pasting should be relatively lag free, as the number of blocks being placed per tick is restricted. A progress bar will appear to give you an indication of how long the schematic will take to process.
      usage: /<command> paste
    clear:
      description: Clears an area selected with the TARDIS schematic wand.
      usage: /<command> clear
    replace:
      description: Replaces the specified block type within an area selected with the TARDIS schematic wand with the second block type.
      usage: /<command> replace [material] [material]
    convert:
      description: Converts lamps and sea lanterns to TARDIS light blocks e.g. use \`/tardisschematic convert TENTH REDSTONE_LAMP\` to convert all redstone lamps in the selected area to Tenth TARDIS lights.
      usage: /<command> convert [light] [material]
    remove:
      description: Removes TARDIS light blocks and replaces them with redstone lamps.
      usage: /<command> remove

:::note

While it is possible to paste schematics, it is still recommended to use a plugin such as WorldEdit to do this sort of work.
