# The Remote command

This command lets you remotely control a TARDIS, and is useful for server admins and command blocks.

<CommandTable data={
`tardisremote:
    aliases: tremote
    description: Remote control a TARDIS.
    permission: tardis.remote
    usage: /<command> [player] [action] [options...]
    `
}
args={
    `
    travel:
      description: >
        Make a player’s TARDIS travel to the specified location. Travel options are:
        
        - \`home\`
        
        - \`area [area name]\`
        
        - coordinates e.g. \`world x y z\`
      usage: /<command> [player] travel [home|area|coords]
    comehere:
      description: Make a player’s TARDIS come to the currently targeted block
      usage: /<command> [player] comehere
    hide:
      description: Hide a player’s TARDIS
      usage: /<command> [player] hide
    rebuild:
      description: Rebuild a player’s TARDIS
      usage: /<command> [player] rebuild
    back:
      description: Make a player’s TARDIS travel to its previous location
      usage: /<command> [player] back    
    `
}
cmd='tardisremote'

</CommandTable>

:::note

- can be run from command blocks, but the specified player must be online
- if the player who is running the command does **NOT** have `tardis.admin` permission, then the normal checks are
  performed (energy/permissions/circuits/plugin respect etc for the specified player)
- use via Command Block will fail silently if above checks fail, as we can’t message a command block...
- if player has `tardis.admin` permission then no energy is used / only basic checks performed (so we’re not griefing
  anything)
- `comehere` comes to the currently targeted block (only available to TARDIS admin players)
