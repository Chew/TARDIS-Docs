## Setting config options

Most TARDIS plugin config options can be set ingame or via the console, and take effect immediately.

There are three types of config options:

1.  Boolean values e.g. true or false
2.  String values e.g. the names of things, like the TARDIS key
3.  Integer values e.g. numbers, like the cost of a room

To use the `/tardisconfig` command to set config options, you use the syntax:

    /tardisconfig [config option] [value]

For example, to set the TARDIS to never land on water you would type:

    /tardisconfig land_on_water false

## Config options:

The following values will be set in _config.yml_:

## Reloading the config

If you have made changes to the config file by manually editing it, you should use the reload command to reload the changes. Type:

    /tardisconfig reload

:::note

Do not use the server `/reload` command or the manual changes you have made will be overwritten when the TARDIS config is saved when it is disabled.
