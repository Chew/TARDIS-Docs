# Time Travel Commands

:::note

If the plugin difficulty is set to `hard` you will need to use the
TARDIS [Advanced Console](advanced-console) instead of these commands.

:::

Some of these commands also require the appropriate permission before players can use them. See
the [Permissions](permissions#ttperms) page for more information.

## Coordinates travel

To travel to specific coordinates, type:

    /tardistravel [world] [x] [y] [z]

| Usage                                    | Description                                                             |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/tardistravel New_New_York -319 64 277` | to travel to coordinates in the _specified world_                       |
| `/tardistravel ~ -319 64 277`            | to travel to coordinates in the _world that the TARDIS is currently in_ |

    /tardistravel ~[x] ~[y] ~[z]

| Usage                      | Description                        |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `/tardistravel ~20 ~ ~-35` | to travel to relative coordinates. |

:::note Relative coordinates

All coordinates must be proceeded by the
tilde character (`~`). In this case the TARDIS would travel `20` blocks in the x-direction (EAST), `0` blocks in the
y-direction (UP/DOWN) and negative `35` blocks in the z-direction (NORTH) from its current location.
