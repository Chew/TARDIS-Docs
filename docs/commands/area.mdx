### Yards

`/tardisarea yard [name] [material] [material]` - type this to visually mark the
area with parking spots, where:

- `[name]` is the area name that you want to change
- the first `[material]` is the block you want to use as the floor of the area
  — defaults to COBBLESTONE if not specified
- the second `[material]` is the block you want to use to mark the parking spot
  — defaults to BRICK if not specified

## Semi-random parking areas

You can set up an area where parking spaces are assigned manually instead of in a grid-like fashion,
for example like in the image below, where each red cross is a parking spot.

To create a non-grid type area, type:

`tardisarea create [name]`

To assign parking spots to the area, stand at the location you want a TARDIS to park and use the command:

`tardisarea add [name]` - where `name` is the area the parking spot should belong to.

To edit parking spots in a non-grid area, use the command:

`tardisarea edit [name]` - where `name` is the area to edit.

A chest GUI will open, allowing you to remove existing parking spots, or add the location where you are currently
standing.
