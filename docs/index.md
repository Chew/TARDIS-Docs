# TARDIS

TARDIS is a Spigot / Paper plugin that allows you to create a TARDIS that lets you time travel (teleport) to random
locations. It adds a Whovian twist to the typical `/sethome` and `/home` commands.

**As a player, you can:**

- Create a TARDIS that is bigger on the inside &mdash; _choose from 30+ different consoles!_
- Time travel to random locations, saved destinations, structures, caves, biomes and players.
- Use the Chameleon Circuit to change the TARDIS exterior &mdash; _over 90+ presets, plus you can make your own._
- Grow rooms in your TARDIS &mdash; _there are 40+ to choose from and you can create your own._
- Take companions with you when you time travel.
- Collect Artron Energy to power your TARDIS.
- Use a sonic screwdriver, vortex manipulator, and many other Doctor Who related items.
- Interact with _20+ custom monsters_ such as Weeping Angels, Cybermen, Sontarans and Sea Devils. 
- Visit the planets Gallifrey, Skaro and Siluria and find custom structures to raid.
