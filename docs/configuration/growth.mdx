<ConfigTable data={`
growth:
    gravity_max_distance: 15
    gravity_max_velocity: 5 # Sets sets the maximum distance and velocity a gravity well can be set to.
    rooms_require_blocks: false # Sets whether growing a room requires the player to condense the materials required to grow the room in the TARDIS condenser.
    rooms_condenser_percent: 100 # Sets the percentage of the actual blocks that a player needs to condense if \`rooms_require_blocks: true\`
    return_room_seed: true # Sets whether the room seed block is returned to the player when they jettison the room.
    room_speed: 4 # Sets the speed (in blocks per second) at which rooms are grown. Maximum speed is \`20\` which is one block per tick.
    delay_factor: 1 # Sets the delay between growing multiple rooms.
    ars_limit: 1 # Sets the maximum number of rooms that can be reconfigured at a time.
