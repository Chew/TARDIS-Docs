# Rechargers configuration section

**NB:** The rechargers configuration section is found in the file: `config.yml`

The rechargers section holds the locations of the TARDIS recharge beacons.

The format is:

    rechargers:
       [name]:
          world: [world]
          x: [co-ordinate]
          y: [co-ordinate]
          z: [co-ordinate]

Entries are added automatically by the `/tardisadmin recharger [name]` command, you should only need to edit this
section if you want to remove a recharge point.
