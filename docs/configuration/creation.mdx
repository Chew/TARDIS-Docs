<ConfigTable data={`
creation:
    create_worlds: false # It is **NOT recommended** setting this to true! Sets whether TARDISes are created in their own separate worlds.
    create_worlds_with_perms: false # Sets whether TARDISes are created in their own separate worlds for players with the appropriate permission — \`tardis.create_world\`.
    default_world: true # Sets whether TARDISes are created in a shared world. Also required to be true to enable the Junk TARDIS and the abilty to abandon TARDISes.
    default_world_name: TARDIS_TimeVortex # Sets the name of the default world. This is only used if \`default_world\` is true.
    border_radius: 256 # Sets the distance of the WorldBorder barrier (only used if the plugin is installed on the server).
    inventory_group: 0 # If the Multiverse-Inventories plugin is enabled on the server, you can set the group that TARDIS worlds are added to when they are created.
    add_perms: true # Sets whether a TARDIS world is assigned permissions when the server uses a permissions plugin that has per-world configuration — see [Add permissions](/add-permissions).
    use_clay: WOOL # Sets whether the coloured wool in TARDIS console and room schematics is switched to stained terracotta or concrete instead. Valid options are WOOL, TERRACOTTA, and CONCRETE.
    count: 0 # Sets the maximum number of times a player can build and destroy a TARDIS. If set to \`0\` there is NO maximum.
    tips_limit: 400 # Sets the number of T.I.P.S slots to use. Must be one of 400, 800, 1200 or 1600.
    area: none # If set to a pre-defined TARDIS area, it will set that area as the only place on the server that TARDISes can be created in.
    enable_legacy: true # Sets whether the legacy console schematics are available to build TARDIS interiors with.
    check_for_home: true # Sets whether the TARDIS creation location is already set to another player's \`home\` location.
    seed_block_crafting: true # Sets whether players can craft TARDIS seed blocks.
