# Planet configuration options

Worlds are added and removed automatically when the plugin is enabled — it will find newly added worlds, and
remove worlds that no longer exist.

You should rarely need to edit this section, as worlds can be included or excluded using
the `/tardisadmin include [world]` and `/tardisadmin exclude [world]` commands.

These are the plugin planet configuration options.

Each world on your server has their own section in _planets.yml__, however there are TARDIS specific worlds as
well:

- [Skaro](planets#planet-skaro)
- [Siluria](planets#planet-siluria)
- [Gallifrey](planets#planet-gallifrey)
