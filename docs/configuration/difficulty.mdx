# Difficulty

TARDIS version 5.6.0 and below have only one difficulty setting - `preferences.difficulty: [easy|medium|hard]`.
From version 5.7.0 and higher, difficulty is set per feature as shown below, allowing for finer control of which features you want to make harder or easier.

## Configuration options

The defaults are shown below:

```yaml title="/plugins/TARDIS/config.yml"
difficulty:
  crafting: easy
  circuits: false
  disks: false
  disk_in_hand_for_write: true
  biome_reader: true
  stattenheim_remote: false
  tardis_locator: false
  system_upgrades: false
```
