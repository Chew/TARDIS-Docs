# Eye of Harmony Room

The Eye of Harmony Room is the location of the TARDISÊ¼s captured star. The star is in the act of becoming a black hole, allowing the TARDIS to harness the potential energy of a collapse that will never occur.

The main purpose of the room is to increase the Artron Storage capacity of the TARDIS.

## Creation

You can grow the EYE room using the [Architectural Reconfiguration System](/ars).

## Features

The Eye of Harmony Room has several features, including:

- Custom biome with ambient particles.
- Burning star particle effects.
- Its proximity to an exploding star makes it a harmful environment - see configuration options below.
- Ossified Time Zombies may spawn in the room.
- Allows you to increase the Artron Energy storage capacity by adding [Artron Capacitors](/artron-capacitor).

## Configuration

```yaml title="/plugins/TARDIS/config.yml"
eye_of_harmony:
  player_damage: true
  damage_amount: 0.5
