# Smelter Room

The Smelter room lets you automate the process of smelting ores and other raw materials.

The room contains a ring of 16 chests, hoppers and furnaces which are fed by adding items to two chests in the centre of the room.

* The lower chest is the **fuel** chest &mdash; add any items that can be burnt, such as coal, logs etc.
* The upper chest is the **ore** chest &mdash; add the items that you want to smelt in here.

When you close the chests, the TARDIS distributes the items evenly to the surrounding chests. Smelting should start automatically.
