# Library Room

As of TARDIS v5.4.0b2797 the Library room will automatically sort books into the chiselled bookshelves contained within it.

When the room is grown a 'drop' chest is added to the room. Books placed in the drop chest will automatically be sent to the appropriately labelled chiselled bookshelf when you close the chest.

Enchanted books are stored around the outside of the room.
Books, book and quills, written books, and knowledge books are stored around the centre of the room.

If you have an old Library room, you will need to jettison it and grow the new Library.
