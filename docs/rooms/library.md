# Library Room

As of TARDIS v5.4.0b2797 the Library room will automatically sort books into the chiselled bookshelves contained within it.

When the room is grown a 'drop' chest is added to the room. Books placed in the drop chest will automatically be sent to the appropriately labelled chiselled bookshelf when you close the chest.

Enchanted books are stored around the outside of the room.
Books, book and quills, written books, and knowledge books are stored around the centre of the room.

:::info Copper golems

If you change the regular library drop chest to a trapped chest (making sure you keep the same location), any items placed into the chest by a copper golem will be sorted as well.

:::warning Lunge enchanted books

If you grew a Library room before TARDIS v6.3.11, then chiseled book shelves for the three levels of Lunge enchanted books will be missing - you can add them to an existing library by using the command `/tardis update lunge`.

:::tip

If you have an old Library room, you will need to jettison it and grow the new Library.
