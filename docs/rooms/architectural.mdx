# Architectural Reconfiguration Room

If the [blueprints module](/modules/blueprints) is enabled, the Architectural Reconfiguration room lets you clone room blueprint disks and give them to other players.

## Blueprints

To access the Architectural Blueprints GUI, right-click the gray shulker box at the base of the Architectural Reconfiguration System tree. As well as showing you what room blueprints you have collected, you can also share blueprints with other players.
