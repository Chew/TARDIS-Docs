# Happy Ghast Room

TARDIS provides an easy way to get Happy Ghasts into its interior using its mob farming feature.

## To farm Happy Ghasts

Setting up the system is a multi-step process:

1. Grow a happy room
2. Land and exit your TARDIS
3. Herd Happy Ghasts so that they are close to the Police Box (within 4 blocks) — using a snowball or harness in hand should to make them follow you
4. Enter the TARDIS

## The Happy Room

- There is storage for 19 happy ghasts in total
   - 1 full size regular happy ghast in the "dock"
   - 18 "extra" leashed dried ghast blocks.
- The dock will always be the first location to be filled if it is empty.
- If the dock is occupied the "extra" locations will be filled.
- The 18 extras will save the harness/name/adult/baby/age/health attributes that they had before they were brought into the TARDIS.
- If the full sized happy ghast is carrying a leashed boat / boat with chest, the boat will come with it (and any items in the chest) - other entities will be released - use the other farm rooms to transport them inside.
- "Extra" ghasts will have boats / other entities released before being transported into the TARDIS

## Ejecting Happy Ghasts

- There is a lever on the dock to release the full sized happy ghast. Any passengers onboard the Happy Ghast will also be teleported to the TARDIS exterior.
- Extra happy ghasts will be recreated at the exterior when the leash is cut with **shears**.

## "Extras"

Extras are stored as leashed dried ghast item displays. If the Happy Ghast that was farmed had a harness, the dried ghast will have a coloured bar reflecting the harness colour above its head.
