# Whovian Food

You can craft Whovian food items in-game so that you can eat like the Doctor.

For best results (and custom textures) you should use the [TARDIS-Resource-Pack](resource-packs).

colour. To see the recipe type:

    /tardisrecipe jelly-baby

Each recipe gives 4 coloured jelly babies, eating a jelly baby restores one hunger.

recipe, Jammy Dodgers are crafted the same way as cookies, but instead of cocoa beans, 1 red dye is used. To see the

    /tardisrecipe jammy-dodger

## Custard Creams

The thirteenth Doctor thought that Custard Creams were "the best" type of biscuit. A shaped
recipe, Custard Creams are crafted the same way as cookies, but instead of cocoa beans, 1 yellow dye is used. To see the
recipe type:

    /tardisrecipe custard-cream

Each recipe gives 8 Custard Creams, eating a Custard Cream restores 1 hunger.

### Custard cream dispenser

The Custard cream dispenser is an updateable component of the TARDIS console. When clicked it gives a player a custard cream and consumes an amount of Artron energy.

To add a Custard cream dispenser to your TARDIS:

1. Place a dispenser block inside the TARDIS.
2. Run the command `/tardis update dispenser`.
3. Follow the instructions and click the dispenser block.
