<TabbedImage name={"Sonic Dock"} description={"A sonic screwdriver placed in the sonic dock."} folder={"docs"} image={"sonic-dock.jpg"} />

To add a sonic dock:

1. Craft a sonic dock to see the recipe use the command `/tardisrecipe sonic-dock`
   <TabbedImage name={"Sonic Dock recipe"} description={"The sonic dock recipe."} folder={"docs"} image={"sonic-dock-recipe.jpg"} />
2. Place an item frame facing upwards somewhere inside your TARDIS
3. Place the sonic dock into the item frame
4. Use the update command to register the sonic dock with the plugin - `/tardis update sonic-dock`

To dock your sonic screwdriver:

* Right-click the dock with the _sonic in your main hand_.

To remove the sonic from the dock:

* Right-click the dock with an _empty hand_.


## Charging

If the plugin difficulty is set to `hard` or the plugin is [configured](#configuration) the sonic dock is used to charge your device. Charging will start automatically when the screwdriver is docked.

## Configuration

_config.yml_ contains a `sonic` configuration section with the following defaults:

```yaml title="/plugins/TARDIS/config.yml"
sonic:
  charge: false
  charge_level: 1000
  charge_interval: 60
  usage: 10
```

The settings are explained below:

<ConfigTable data={`
sonic:
  charge: false # Sets whether players need to charge their sonic screwdriver to use it
  charge_level: 1000 # The maximum charge level a sonic device can hold
  charge_interval: 60 # The amount of time it takes to charge a sonic device to full charge
  usage: 10 # The amount of energy a sonic screwdriver consumes each time it is used
`} />
