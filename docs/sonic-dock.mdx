# Sonic Dock

You can place a sonic dock in your TARDIS console to hold your sonic devices.

<TabbedImage name={"Sonic Dock"} description={"A sonic screwdriver placed in the sonic dock."} folder={"docs"} image={"sonic-dock.jpg"} />

To add a sonic dock:

1. Craft a sonic dock to see the recipe use the command `/tardisrecipe sonic-dock`
   <TabbedImage name={"Sonic Dock recipe"} description={"The sonic dock recipe."} folder={"docs"} image={"sonic-dock-recipe.jpg"} />
2. Place an item frame facing upwards somewhere inside your TARDIS
3. Place the sonic dock into the item frame
4. Use the update command to register the sonic dock with the plugin - `/tardis update sonic-dock`

To dock your sonic screwdriver:

* Right-click the dock with the _sonic in your main hand_.

To remove the sonic from the dock:

* Right-click the dock with an _empty hand_.

## Setting travel coordinates

If the sonic screwdriver you have docked has been upgraded with the Emerald Environment Circuit, the last scanned block or player location will be loaded into the TARDIS memory bank.
Release the handbrake to travel to the location.

:::tip

If the [Relativity Differentiator](flying#how-to-fly) has been installed in the console and is turned on, the TARDIS will automatically disengage the handbrake and travel to the destination.

## Charging

If the plugin difficulty is set to `hard` or the plugin is [configured](#configuration), the sonic dock is used to charge your device. Charging will start automatically when the screwdriver is docked.

The TARDIS must have sufficient energy to recharge the sonic.

## Configuration

_config.yml_ contains a `sonic` configuration section with the following defaults:

```yaml title="/plugins/TARDIS/config.yml"
sonic:
  default_model: eleventh
  conversion_radius: 1
  freeze_cooldown: 60
  charge: false
  charge_level: 1000
  charge_interval: 60
  usage: 10
```

The settings are explained below:

<ConfigTable data={`
sonic:
  default_model: eleventh # Sets the custom model that sonic screwdrivers appear with when crafted or given
  conversion_radius: 1 # Sets the radius of blocks that is transformed by the Sonic Screwdriver conversion function. Using a value 1 gives a 3x3 area of blocks. Setting to 0 means only the clicked block is affected
  freeze_cooldown: 60 # Sets the cool down period (in seconds) between uses of the Sonic Screwdriverâ€™s player freeze function
  charge: false # Sets whether players need to charge their sonic screwdriver to use it
  charge_level: 1000 # The maximum charge level a sonic device can hold
  charge_interval: 60 # The amount of time it takes to charge a sonic device to full charge
  usage: 10 # The amount of energy a sonic screwdriver consumes each time it is used
`} />
