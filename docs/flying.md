# Flying the TARDIS

From version 5 of the TARDIS plugin, you can fly the TARDIS exterior around your worlds.
_This is a __Java__ only feature that works with custom model police box presets_, so you will also need to use the
[TARDIS-Resource-Pack](/resource-packs).

### Permission

You will need the permission `tardis.fly` to pilot your TARDIS.

## How to fly

- Add a Relativity Differentiator to your TARDIS console - place a comparator and run the command `/tardis update relativity-differentiator`
- Set the comparator to _Subtract_ mode

- __Right-click__ the handbrake to pilot the TARDIS in the world
- Use the __W__) to speed up
- Use the __S__) to slow down
- Use the mouse to naviagte up, down, left, right
- Hold down the space bar to hover
- Hold a glass bottle in your main hand to hide the exterior while flying
- Hold your sonic screwdriver in your main hand to stop the police box from spinning
- Use your sonic screwdriver to toggle the exterior door open and closed
- Press the __Dismount__ key (by default __Shift__) to stop flying (best to do this when on the ground!)

When you click the handbrake, you will be teleported to the TARDIS exterior - you will most
likely want to switch your view to third-person mode by pressing the __F5__ key on the keyboard.
Pressing the Shift key will teleport you back into the TARDIS interior - you'll probably want to be on the ground at
the time, though the TARDIS will happily stop in mid-air. Left-click the handbrake to park the TARDIS and exit.

To return to normal flight set the Relativity Differentiator comparator back to _Compare_ mode.

The TARDIS must have _at least 4 AIR blocks above it_ to be able to fly
