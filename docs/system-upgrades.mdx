# System Upgrades

From version 5.7.0 and higher, you can restrict feature use using System Upgrades. Players can upgrade their TARDISes to gain access to more powerful features for architecture, navigation, flight, tools and miscellaneous others, but only once they have used their TARDIS for a while.

Upgrades are performed in the System Upgrades GUI where features can exchanged for Time Lord Artron Energy. Gaining Time Lord Artron Energy requires that players travel in their TARDIS and exit the door - the amount of energy accumulated each time they travel is set in [_artron.yml_](/configuration/energy#player).

This is a progressive system where more advanced features can only be unlocked after the previous feature in a branch has been unlocked.

You can view how much Time Lord Artron Energy you have by hovering over the _Upgrade tree_ icon.
