Choose the link that matches your server version.

* * *

:::caution

TARDIS v5.x.x does NOT need TARDISChunkGenerator - do not install it!

:::

:::info

If upgrading from a previous version of TARDIS, see [Updating from v4.x.x to v5.x.x](updating-to-unified-plugin) for more information.

:::

You install TARDIS just like you would any other Spigot/Paper plugin, by dropping it into the Spigot / Paper plugins folder and starting the server.

The TARDIS database, configuration, schematic and advancement files will be created automatically.

:::tip

<p>For the plugin to have full functionality and work correctly you should have the latest Spigot / Paper server (currently version <code>{siteVariables.serverVersion}</code>).</p>

The TARDIS plugin has evolved into a complex beast, with things that unexperienced server administrators may have trouble with. If you have difficulties, ask for help on the [TARDIS community Discord server](https://discord.gg/sfuPVHh), or create a ticket on the [issues page](https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/TARDIS/issues).

## Installation:

Place the `TARDIS.jar` file in your plugins folder.

You will most probably need to run a permissions plugin for players to actually use the TARDIS (it’s possible without one, but players will need to be opped!). As a minimum players will generally need the `tardis.use` permission to build a TARDIS, and `tardis.enter` to be a companion.

If this is your first time using the plugin, you may want to set the TARDIS difficulty mode to _easy_. To do this use the in-game command: `/tardisconfig difficulty easy`.

## Enhancing the TARDIS plugin

While not essential to make the TARDIS plugin work, the following plugins will make your Time Travelling experience even better.

1. Install [WorldGuard](https://enginehub.org/worldguard) to automatically protect your TARDIS from griefing.
2. Install a permissions plugin, so that you can restrict or grant players the rights to use TARDIS’ different features. We like [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/). To see how you can setup LuckPerms with TARDIS, visit the [Using a permissions plugin](permissions-plugin) page.
3. (Optional) Install [LibsDisguises](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/libs-disguises-free.81/) so that you can use the Genetic Manipulator / Immortality Gate. 

   :::note
   
   TARDIS can now create its own disguises, but LibsDisguises does a much better job of it!

4. Install the [TARDIS-Resource-Pack](resource-packs) so that you see re-textured TARDIS blocks and items, and hear TARDIS sounds.
