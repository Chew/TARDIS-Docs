# TARDIS Chemistry Lab Compounds

The [Chemistry Lab](./index) can produce compounds, typically used in crafting Products!

to [chemistry lab products](products), to view how to use the chemistry lab, go to
the [chemistry lab page](./index). To view a list elements, go to the [elements page](elements)_
